# To-Do List

## Objectives

-   Have a functioning minimalistic To-Do List in order to demonstrate basic react native skills.

-   Make sure this simple app works on Android and iOS

## Styling

Very minimal styling was applied. Background image and some tweaks to make it work.

## Usability

Type in an item and hit the "Done" button on the keyboard (keeps elements to a minimum). Delete button is available along with a checkbox to show finished tasks.

## Technologies Used

-   Expo
-   React Native

## Why a To-Do List

I recently hit a snag along with a massive code-block where I couldn't finish any project. This was a one day build to rehabilitate myself from that failure.

The second reason for doing this is actually more important. I'm learning to optimize my workflow using Expo to build for both iOS and Android using a Linux machine. This has been done before, but there are still some issues I wish to unfold.

More complex apps are in the making for my public GitHub Account. Experimentation with Expo push notification service is also an addition I will add at a later time; however, I'm also considering building my own push notifiation server to limit data collection by other services.
